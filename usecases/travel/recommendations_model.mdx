# Deploying AI-Powered Product Recommendations for E-commerce

## Overview

Creating and deploying recommendation systems for e-commerce platforms involves handling large datasets, feature engineering, model selection, and optimization. Delivering accurate, scalable, and performant solutions in production is critical.

Plexe simplifies deployment, enabling tuning and customization while leveraging advanced model-building capabilities. It adapts to workflows from raw data to quick prototypes.

## Quick Start

Install the Plexe library:

```bash
pip install plexe
```

Here's a basic example to get started:

```python
import plexe

model_version = plexe.build(
    goal="""Develop a product recommendation system for e-commerce to suggest complementary products based on browsing, purchase history, and cart data.""",
    model_name="ecommerce-recsys",
    data_files=["product_data.csv", "user_behavior.json"]
)

status = plexe.get_status(
    model_name="ecommerce-recsys", 
    model_version=model_version
)

recommendations = plexe.infer(
    model_name="ecommerce-recsys",
    model_version=model_version,
    input_data={
        "user_id": "12345",
        "current_cart": ["product_001", "product_005"],
        "context": "holiday season"
    }
)
```

## Authentication

Set up your API key using one of these methods:

1. Environment variable:
```bash
export PLEXE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

2. Direct client initialization:
```python
from plexe import PlexeAI
client = PlexeAI(api_key="your-api-key")
```

## Fine-Tuning and Customization

Update your model with new data and custom parameters:

```python
from plexe import PlexeAI

client = PlexeAI(api_key="your-api-key")

upload_id = client.upload_files([
    "updated_product_data.csv",
    "new_user_activity.json"
])

new_model_version = client.build(
    goal="Fine-tune the recommendation system with updated product and user activity data.",
    model_name="ecommerce-recsys",
    upload_id=upload_id
)
```

## Batch Processing

Process multiple recommendations efficiently:

```python
recommendations = plexe.batch_infer(
    model_name="ecommerce-recsys",
    model_version=model_version,
    inputs=[
        {
            "user_id": "12345",
            "current_cart": ["product_001", "product_005"],
            "context": "holiday season"
        },
        {
            "user_id": "67890",
            "current_cart": ["product_010"],
            "context": "back-to-school"
        }
    ]
)
```

## Production Implementation

Deploy with FastAPI for production-ready async support:

```python
import asyncio
from fastapi import FastAPI
from plexe import PlexeAI

app = FastAPI()
client = PlexeAI(api_key="your-api-key")

@app.post("/recommendations")
async def get_recommendations(data: dict):
    recommendations = await client.ainfer(
        model_name="ecommerce-recsys",
        model_version="your_model_version",
        input_data=data
    )
    return recommendations

@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    await client.async_client.aclose()
```
