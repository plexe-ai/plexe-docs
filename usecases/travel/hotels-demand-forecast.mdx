# AI-Powered Demand Forecasting for Travel Technology

## The Challenge

Travel technology platforms need accurate demand forecasting to optimize inventory, pricing, and revenue management across different markets and seasons. Traditional methods struggle with complex patterns involving seasonality, events, market variations, and changing customer preferences.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Demand Forecasting

Using Plexe's AI platform, companies can implement sophisticated demand forecasting without ML expertise. Just describe what you need, upload your data (or use our default datasets), and Plexe handles the rest.

### Quick Start Example

```python
from plexe import PlexeAI

# Initialize and create model in one go
ai = PlexeAI()
model_id, version, _ = ai.create(
    """Create a demand forecasting model that predicts hotel room demand 
    for the next 90 days considering seasonality, events, and market segments.""",
    data=["historical_bookings.csv", "events.pdf"]  # Optional: your own data
)

# Get predictions
forecast = ai.run(
    model_id=model_id,
    inputs={
        "dates": "2024-06-01/2024-06-07",
        "room_type": "deluxe",
        "location": "downtown"
    }
)
```

### Using Default Data

```python
# No data? No problem! Use our pre-trained models
ai = PlexeAI()
model_id, version, _ = ai.create(
    """Create a demand forecasting model that predicts hotel room demand."""
)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Get multiple forecasts at once
forecasts = ai.batch_run(
    model_id=model_id,
    inputs=[
        {
            "dates": "2024-06-01/2024-06-07",
            "room_type": "deluxe",
            "location": "downtown"
        },
        {
            "dates": "2024-06-01/2024-06-07",
            "room_type": "suite",
            "location": "resort"
        }
    ]
)
```

### API Integration

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from plexe import PlexeAI

app = FastAPI()
ai = PlexeAI()

@app.post("/forecast")
async def get_forecast(data: dict):
    forecast = await ai.arun(
        model_id="your_model_id",
        inputs=data
    )
    return forecast
```
