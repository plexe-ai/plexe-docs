# AI-Powered Demand Forecasting for Travel Technology
## The Challenge
Travel technology platforms need accurate demand forecasting to optimize inventory, pricing, and revenue management across different markets and seasons. Traditional methods struggle with complex patterns involving seasonality, events, market variations, and changing customer preferences.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Demand Forecasting
Using Plexe's AI platform, companies can implement sophisticated demand forecasting without ML expertise. Just describe what you need, upload your data (or use our default datasets), and Plexe handles the rest.

### Quick Start Example
```python
import plexe

# Build the model
model_version = plexe.build(
    model_name="hotel-demand",
    goal="""Create a demand forecasting model that predicts hotel room demand 
    for the next 90 days considering seasonality, events, and market segments.""",
    data_files=["historical_bookings.csv", "events.pdf"]
)

# Check model status
status = plexe.get_status(
    model_name="hotel-demand",
    model_version=model_version
)

# Get predictions
forecast = plexe.infer(
    model_name="hotel-demand",
    model_version=model_version,
    input_data={
        "dates": "2024-06-01/2024-06-07",
        "room_type": "deluxe",
        "location": "downtown"
    }
)
```

### Using Direct Client
```python
from plexe import PlexeAI

with PlexeAI() as client:
    # Upload data and build model
    upload_id = client.upload_files(["historical_bookings.csv", "events.pdf"])
    
    model_version = client.build(
        model_name="hotel-demand",
        goal="Create a demand forecasting model that predicts hotel room demand.",
        upload_id=upload_id
    )
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Get multiple forecasts at once
forecasts = plexe.batch_infer(
    model_name="hotel-demand",
    model_version=model_version,
    inputs=[
        {
            "dates": "2024-06-01/2024-06-07",
            "room_type": "deluxe",
            "location": "downtown"
        },
        {
            "dates": "2024-06-01/2024-06-07",
            "room_type": "suite",
            "location": "resort"
        }
    ]
)
```

### Async Support
```python
import asyncio
from fastapi import FastAPI
from plexe import PlexeAI

app = FastAPI()
ai = PlexeAI()

@app.post("/forecast")
async def get_forecast(data: dict):
    forecast = await ai.ainfer(
        model_name="hotel-demand",
        model_version="your_model_version",
        input_data=data
    )
    return forecast
```
