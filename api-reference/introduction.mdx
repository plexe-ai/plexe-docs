# Plexe API Reference

Welcome to the Plexe API documentation. Plexe is an automated machine learning model generation platform that allows you to create custom ML models from your data with simple API calls.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with all requests:

```bash
x-api-key: your_api_key_here
```

## Base URL

```
https://api.plexe.ai
```

## Workflow

1. Upload your training data files
2. Create a model using the uploaded data
3. Check model training status
4. Use the model for inference once training is complete


## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP response codes:

- 200: Success
- 400: Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- 401: Unauthorized (invalid API key)
- 404: Not Found (invalid model_name or model_version)
- 500: Internal Server Error

Error responses include a detail message:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error description"
}
```
