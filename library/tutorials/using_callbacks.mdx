title: 'Using Callbacks for Monitoring'
description: 'Monitor the model building process using built-in and custom callbacks, including MLflow integration.'
---

Plexe provides a callback system that allows you to hook into various stages of the `model.build()` process. This is useful for logging, monitoring, custom artifact handling, or triggering external processes.

## The Callback System

Callbacks are classes that inherit from `plexe.Callback` and implement one or more of the following methods:

* `on_build_start(info: BuildStateInfo)`: Called once at the beginning of the `build` process.
* `on_build_end(info: BuildStateInfo)`: Called once at the end of the `build` process (after success or error).
* `on_iteration_start(info: BuildStateInfo)`: Called at the start of each model building iteration (solution attempt).
* `on_iteration_end(info: BuildStateInfo)`: Called at the end of each model building iteration.

The `BuildStateInfo` object passed to these methods contains contextual information like the model intent, provider used, schemas, datasets, current iteration number, and the current solution `Node` being evaluated (especially relevant in `on_iteration_end`).

## Built-in Callbacks

Plexe includes some useful built-in callbacks:

### `ChainOfThoughtModelCallback`

This callback is automatically added when you set `chain_of_thought=True` in `model.build()`. It captures the agent reasoning steps and emits them using an emitter (defaults to `ConsoleEmitter`). You generally don't need to instantiate this directly.

### `MLFlowCallback`

This callback logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts from the build process to an [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html) server.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  Install MLflow: `pip install mlflow`
2.  Have an MLflow tracking server running or use local file logging.

**Usage:**

```python
import plexe
import pandas as pd
from plexe.callbacks import MLFlowCallback # Import the callback

# --- Prepare Data (as in Quickstart) ---
try:
    df = pd.read_csv("housing_data.csv")
except FileNotFoundError:
    df = pd.DataFrame({ # Dummy data
        'square_footage': [1500, 2100, 1800, 2500, 1200], 'bedrooms': [3, 4, 3, 5, 2],
        'bathrooms': [2, 2.5, 2, 3, 1.5], 'price': [300000, 450000, 380000, 550000, 250000]
    })
datasets = [df]
# -----------------------------------------

# --- Define Model (as in Quickstart) ---
model = plexe.Model(
    intent="Predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms."
)
# -----------------------------------------

# Configure MLflow tracking URI (local example)
# Replace with your tracking server URI if applicable (e.g., "http://localhost:5000")
mlflow_tracking_uri = "file:./mlruns"
mlflow_experiment_name = "Plexe_House_Pricing"

# Instantiate the callback
mlflow_callback = MLFlowCallback(
    tracking_uri=mlflow_tracking_uri,
    experiment_name=mlflow_experiment_name
)

print(f"Configured MLflow logging to: {mlflow_tracking_uri}, Experiment: {mlflow_experiment_name}")

# Build the model, passing the callback instance
print("Starting model build with MLflow logging...")
model.build(
    datasets=datasets,
    provider="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    max_iterations=3, # Keep low for quick example
    callbacks=[mlflow_callback], # Pass the callback here
    chain_of_thought=False # Optional: disable default console logging if desired
)

print(f"Model build finished. Check MLflow UI for experiment '{mlflow_experiment_name}'.")
print(f"You can start the local MLflow UI with: mlflow ui --backend-store-uri {mlflow_tracking_uri}")

# You can now inspect the runs in the MLflow UI. Each iteration
# will be logged as a separate run within the specified experiment.
```

<Info>
The `MLFlowCallback` logs:

  * **Parameters:** Intent, provider, schemas, timeouts, iteration number.
  * **Metrics:** Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE) reported by the agent for each iteration, execution time.
  * **Artifacts:** Training code (`trainer_source.py`), model artifacts saved by the training script.
  * **Tags:** Provider used, whether an exception occurred during the iteration.
</Info>

## Creating Custom Callbacks

You can create your own callbacks by subclassing `plexe.Callback`.

**Example: A simple callback to print iteration progress.**

```python
import plexe
import pandas as pd
from plexe.callbacks import Callback, BuildStateInfo # Import base class and info object

# --- Prepare Data & Model (as before) ---
try:
    df = pd.read_csv("housing_data.csv")
except FileNotFoundError:
    df = pd.DataFrame({ # Dummy data
        'square_footage': [1500, 2100, 1800, 2500, 1200], 'bedrooms': [3, 4, 3, 5, 2],
        'bathrooms': [2, 2.5, 2, 3, 1.5], 'price': [300000, 450000, 380000, 550000, 250000]
    })
datasets = [df]
model = plexe.Model(intent="Predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.")
# ---------------------------------------

# Define a custom callback
class ProgressPrinterCallback(Callback):
    def on_build_start(self, info: BuildStateInfo) -> None:
        print(f"ðŸš€ Starting build for intent: '{info.intent[:50]}...'")
        if info.max_iterations:
             print(f"Max iterations: {info.max_iterations}")

    def on_iteration_start(self, info: BuildStateInfo) -> None:
        print(f"\n--- Iteration {info.iteration + 1} Start ---")

    def on_iteration_end(self, info: BuildStateInfo) -> None:
        print(f"--- Iteration {info.iteration + 1} End ---")
        if info.node: # Check if node info is available
             if info.node.performance:
                 print(f"  Performance ({info.node.performance.name}): {info.node.performance.value:.4f}")
             else:
                 print("  Performance: Not available")

             if info.node.exception_was_raised:
                 print(f"  Status: Failed ({type(info.node.exception).__name__})")
             else:
                 print("  Status: Success")
        else:
             print("  Node info not available for this iteration.")


    def on_build_end(self, info: BuildStateInfo) -> None:
        print(f"\nâœ… Build process finished.")

# Instantiate the custom callback
progress_callback = ProgressPrinterCallback()

# Build the model with the custom callback
model.build(
    datasets=datasets,
    provider="openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    max_iterations=2,
    callbacks=[progress_callback], # Add custom callback
    chain_of_thought=False # Disable default verbose logging
)

```

By implementing custom callbacks, you can integrate Plexe's model building process seamlessly into your existing workflows and monitoring systems.
