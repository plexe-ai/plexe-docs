Plexe.ai enables anyone to create and deploy custom machine learning models in minutes—without large datasets or ML expertise. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or business professional, Plexe simplifies the end-to-end model creation process using natural language descriptions and synthetic data generation.

Now, with our open-source library, [smolmodels](https://github.com/plexe-ai/smolmodels), you can define, train, and deploy models entirely in code—without depending on a managed platform.

### **🔍 What is Plexe?**

Plexe is an ML model generation platform that enables you to:&#x20;

1. Define models using natural language

2. Generate high-quality synthetic training data

3. Train efficient, specialized models on the fly

4. Deploy models instantly for real-world use

With smolmodels, you get the same experience in an open-source library—giving you full control over model creation, data generation, and deployment.



### **🏎️ Introducing smolmodels**

[smolmodels](https://github.com/plexe-ai/smolmodels) is the **open-source core** of Plexe, designed to let you do all the good stuff mentioned above.

### 👉 **Get started:**

Install with:

```
pip install smolmodels
```

Try a basic example:

```
import smolmodels as sm

# Define the model
model = sm.Model(
    intent="Classify email as spam or not",
    input_schema={"subject": str, "body": str},
    output_schema={"label": str}
)

# Train the model
model.build(generate_samples=1000)

# Make predictions
prediction = model.predict({"subject": "Win a free iPhone!", "body": "Click here to claim your prize"})
print(prediction)
```

### **Key Features**

**🌍 No Large Datasets Needed**

Plexe generates synthetic data to train **highly accurate models** without requiring **huge labeled datasets**.

**💡 Works with Any Problem**

Use Plexe to build models for:

* Text classification

* Sentiment analysis

* Prediction tasks

* Decision-making systems

* And any custom ML solutions

**⚡ Fast, Low-Cost, and Efficient**

Unlike traditional ML pipelines, **Plexe automates the entire model-building process**, reducing training time and cost.

### **🛠️ Open-Source & Extensible**

With smolmodels, you can modify, extend, and integrate ML capabilities into your own projects.

### **Join the Community**

We're building the easiest way to create custom ML models—and we'd love your help!
