## Billing Overview

The Plexe Platform uses a flexible billing system based on a combination of subscription tiers and usage-based credits. This approach ensures you only pay for what you actually use while maintaining predictable costs.

## Subscription Tiers

Plexe offers several subscription tiers to accommodate different user needs:

### Free Tier

- Limited monthly credits included
- Basic features for experimentation
- Community support
- Public model deployments only
- Default rate limits apply

### Professional Tier

- More monthly credits included
- Full feature access
- Standard support with response SLAs
- Private model deployments
- Higher rate limits
- Team collaboration features

### Enterprise Tier

- Custom credit allocations
- All features plus enterprise extras
- Priority support with dedicated contacts
- Advanced security and compliance features
- Custom rate limits
- Advanced team management
- On-premises deployment options (where available)

## Credit System

Credits are the unified currency used to measure and bill for resource usage on the Plexe Platform.

### What Are Credits?

Credits represent computational resources consumed across various platform operations. Major operations that consume credits include:

1. **Model Building:** The core process of creating ML models
2. **Model Inference:** Making predictions with deployed models
3. **Data Storage:** Storing datasets and model artifacts
4. **Model Deployment:** Maintaining active model endpoints

### Credit Allocation

Each subscription tier includes a monthly allocation of credits:

| Tier | Monthly Credits | Rollover Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 500 | No rollover |
| Professional | 5,000 | 3-month rollover |
| Enterprise | Custom | Negotiable |

Once you exhaust your monthly credits, you can either:
- Purchase additional credit packs
- Upgrade to a higher subscription tier
- Wait for the next billing cycle for replenishment

### Credit Costs

Different operations consume different amounts of credits:

| Operation | Credit Cost | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model Building | 50-500 | Varies by complexity, data size, and iterations |
| Model Inference | 0.1-1 | Varies by model complexity and input size |
| Data Storage | 0.01 per MB/day | For active datasets and models |
| Model Deployment | 1-10 per hour | Varies by performance tier |

These are approximate ranges. The exact credit cost is dynamically calculated based on the specific resources consumed.

## Monitoring Usage

You can monitor your credit usage in several ways:

### Console Dashboard

The [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai) provides a real-time view of your credit usage, including:
- Current credit balance
- Usage history (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Breakdown by operation type
- Projections based on current usage

### API Endpoints

You can programmatically access usage information via the API:

```bash
# Get current credit balance
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/v1/billing/credits \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get usage history
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/v1/billing/usage \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Alerts and Notifications

Set up alerts to notify you when:
- Credit balance falls below a certain threshold
- Unusual usage patterns are detected
- Monthly allocation is close to exhaustion

## Credit Management Strategies

### Optimizing Credit Usage

1. **Limit Build Iterations:** Set reasonable `max_iterations` values
2. **Use Smaller Datasets:** For experimentation, use representative samples
3. **Choose Efficient Providers:** More economical LLM providers use fewer credits
4. **Right-size Deployments:** Match deployment performance to actual needs
5. **Clean Up Unused Resources:** Delete unnecessary deployments and datasets

### Credit Policies

- Credits on Professional and Enterprise plans roll over according to the plan's policy
- Additional credit purchases expire 12 months after purchase
- Credits cannot be exchanged for cash or transferred between accounts
- Free tier credits reset monthly with no rollover

## Billing Administration

### Payment Methods

Plexe accepts the following payment methods:
- Major credit cards
- PayPal
- ACH transfers (for enterprise customers)
- Wire transfers (for enterprise customers)

### Invoices and Receipts

- Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually
- Invoices are sent via email and available in the Console
- Detailed usage reports are included with each invoice
- Tax documents are provided according to local requirements

### Enterprise Billing Options

Enterprise customers have additional billing options:
- Purchase orders
- Custom billing cycles
- Consolidated team/organization billing
- Custom invoicing requirements

## Resource Quotas and Limits

In addition to credit-based limitations, the platform imposes certain quotas and limits to ensure fair usage and system stability:

| Resource | Free Tier | Professional | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Max concurrent builds | 2 | 10 | Custom |
| Max deployed models | 3 | 20 | Custom |
| Max API requests/min | 60 | 300 | Custom |
| Max data upload size | 100MB | 1GB | Custom |

These limits can be adjusted based on subscription tier and special requirements.

## Cost Examples

Here are some example scenarios to help you estimate credit usage:

### Example 1: Simple Classification Model

- Build a basic customer churn classifier (200 credits)
- Deploy on standard tier (5 credits/hour × 720 hours/month = 3,600 credits/month)
- 10,000 predictions per day (10,000 × 0.1 = 1,000 credits/day × 30 = 30,000 credits/month)
- Total: ~33,800 credits/month

### Example 2: Development Workflow

- Build 5 model versions for experimentation (5 × 300 = 1,500 credits)
- Deploy 2 promising models for testing (2 × 3 credits/hour × 48 hours = 288 credits)
- 1,000 test predictions (1,000 × 0.1 = 100 credits)
- Total: ~1,888 credits

## FAQ

**Q: What happens if I run out of credits?**
A: Existing deployments will continue to run for a grace period (typically 48 hours), but you won't be able to build new models or scale existing deployments until you purchase more credits or your allocation refreshes.

**Q: Can I get a refund for unused credits?**
A: Credits included in subscription plans cannot be refunded. For purchased credit packs, refund policies vary by region and are detailed in the Terms of Service.

**Q: How can I estimate credit needs for my use case?**
A: Contact the Plexe sales team for a consultation, or use the usage simulator in the Console to estimate based on your expected workload.

**Q: Are there discounts for high-volume usage?**
A: Yes, enterprise plans offer volume discounts. Contact the sales team for details.
