This guide walks you through the core functionality of the Plexe Platform API, allowing you to build machine learning models and make predictions without managing any infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

* An account on the Plexe Platform (sign up at [console.plexe.ai](https://console.plexe.ai) if you don't have one)
* An API key with the appropriate permissions (can be created in the Console)
* Basic knowledge of making HTTP requests (we'll use `curl` in examples, but you can use any HTTP client)

## Authentication

All API requests require a valid API key passed in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/v1/user/profile \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

<Note>
Protect your API key! Anyone with your key can make API calls on your behalf and incur usage charges.
</Note>

## Step 1: Upload Data

First, let's upload a dataset to use for model training. The API accepts CSV, JSON, or Parquet files.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.plexe.ai/v1/data/upload \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@housing_data.csv" \
  -F "name=Housing Prices Dataset" \
  -F "description=Housing data with price predictions"
```

A successful response will include a `dataset_id` that you'll need for the next step:

```json
{
  "dataset_id": "ds_abc123def456",
  "name": "Housing Prices Dataset",
  "status": "READY",
  "rows": 1200,
  "columns": 4,
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:12:34Z"
}
```

## Step 2: Create a Model

Now, let's build a model using the uploaded dataset. You'll specify the model's intent in natural language:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.plexe.ai/v1/models/build \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "intent": "Predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms",
    "dataset_id": "ds_abc123def456",
    "input_schema": {
      "square_footage": "float",
      "bedrooms": "integer",
      "bathrooms": "float"
    },
    "output_schema": {
      "price": "float"
    }
  }'
```

The response will include a `job_id` that you can use to track the model building progress:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_xyz789uvw123",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "model_id": "mdl_456ghi789jkl",
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:15:45Z"
}
```

## Step 3: Monitor Model Building Progress

Building a model can take a few minutes. You can check the status:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/v1/jobs/job_xyz789uvw123 \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Response while building:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_xyz789uvw123",
  "status": "RUNNING",
  "model_id": "mdl_456ghi789jkl",
  "progress": 65,
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:15:45Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-06-15T08:17:12Z"
}
```

Once complete:

```json
{
  "job_id": "job_xyz789uvw123",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "model_id": "mdl_456ghi789jkl",
  "progress": 100,
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:15:45Z",
  "completed_at": "2023-06-15T08:19:23Z",
  "metrics": {
    "rmse": 15234.56,
    "r2": 0.87,
    "mae": 12345.67
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Deploy the Model

Once the model is built, you can deploy it to make it available for predictions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.plexe.ai/v1/models/mdl_456ghi789jkl/deploy \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "deployment_id": "dep_789mno012pqr",
  "model_id": "mdl_456ghi789jkl",
  "status": "DEPLOYING",
  "endpoint": "https://api.plexe.ai/v1/predict/dep_789mno012pqr",
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:20:45Z"
}
```

## Step 5: Make Predictions

After the model is deployed (check status with `/models/mdl_456ghi789jkl` until `deployment_status` is `READY`), you can make predictions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.plexe.ai/v1/predict/dep_789mno012pqr \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "square_footage": 1850.0,
    "bedrooms": 3,
    "bathrooms": 2.5
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "request_id": "req_123stu456vwx",
  "result": {
    "price": 385000.0
  },
  "model_id": "mdl_456ghi789jkl",
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:25:12Z"
}
```

## Getting Model Information

You can get details about a model:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/v1/models/mdl_456ghi789jkl \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "model_id": "mdl_456ghi789jkl",
  "name": "Housing Price Predictor",
  "intent": "Predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms",
  "status": "READY",
  "deployment_status": "READY",
  "endpoint": "https://api.plexe.ai/v1/predict/dep_789mno012pqr",
  "metrics": {
    "rmse": 15234.56,
    "r2": 0.87,
    "mae": 12345.67
  },
  "input_schema": {
    "square_footage": "float",
    "bedrooms": "integer",
    "bathrooms": "float"
  },
  "output_schema": {
    "price": "float"
  },
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:15:45Z",
  "last_updated": "2023-06-15T08:20:45Z"
}
```
