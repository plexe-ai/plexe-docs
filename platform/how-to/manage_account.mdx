Manage your Plexe Platform account through the web console.

## Signing Up

1.  Go to the [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai) (Replace with actual URL).
2.  Follow the on-screen instructions to sign up using your preferred method (e.g., email/password, Google, GitHub - depending on supported providers).
3.  Verify your email address if required.

## Viewing Account Details

Once logged in, you can typically find your account details in a dedicated "Account" or "Settings" section of the console. This usually includes:

* **User ID:** Your unique identifier within the Plexe system.
* **Email:** The email address associated with your account.
* **Name:** Your display name.
* **Username:** Your assigned username.
* **Account Status:** Whether your account is active.

## Monitoring Usage and Credits

Plexe Platform operations, such as model building and inference, consume compute resources, which are measured in credits.

* **Available Credits:** Check your current credit balance in the "Billing" or "Usage" section of the console. You start with a certain number of free credits (if applicable) or credits obtained through a subscription/purchase.
* **Consumption:** This section usually shows your credit consumption over time or per operation. Operations like building complex models or running many inferences will consume more credits.
* **Billing:** Details about your subscription plan, payment methods, and invoices can typically be found here.

<Info>
  Specific credit costs for operations (e.g., credits per build iteration, credits per inference call) should be available in the "Billing" section or pricing page. The platform automatically deducts credits as you use services. If your balance reaches zero, you may need to purchase more credits or upgrade your plan to continue using paid features.

Refer to the [Billing Explanation](/platform/explanation/billing) page for more details on how credits and consumption work.
