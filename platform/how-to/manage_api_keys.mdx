API keys are used to authenticate your requests to the Plexe Platform API. This guide shows you how to create, use, and manage API keys.

## Creating an API Key

You can create an API key through the Plexe Console UI or via the API.

### Via the Console UI

1. Log in to the [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai)
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Development Key" or "Production Backend")
5. Select the appropriate permission level:
   - **Read-only**: Can only make GET requests
   - **Read & Write**: Can create models, upload data, and make predictions
   - **Admin**: Full access including user management
6. Click **Create Key**
7. **Important**: Copy the key immediately! For security reasons, the full key will only be shown once.

### Via the API

You can also programmatically create API keys (requires an existing key with admin permissions):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.plexe.ai/v1/keys \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Automated Testing Key",
    "permission_level": "read_write",
    "expiration_days": 30
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "key_id": "key_abc123def456",
  "name": "Automated Testing Key",
  "key": "plx_sk_987654321abcdefg...", // Only shown once!
  "permission_level": "read_write",
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T10:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2023-07-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

<Warning>
Store your API key securely! Anyone with your key can make API calls on your behalf and incur usage charges. The full key string (starting with `plx_sk_`) is only shown once at creation time.
</Warning>

## Listing Your API Keys

### Via the Console UI

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in the left sidebar
2. View the list of all active and expired keys

### Via the API

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/v1/keys \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "key_id": "key_abc123def456",
      "name": "Automated Testing Key",
      "last_used": "2023-06-15T11:22:33Z",
      "permission_level": "read_write",
      "created_at": "2023-06-15T10:00:00Z",
      "expires_at": "2023-07-15T10:00:00Z",
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "key_id": "key_ghi789jkl012",
      "name": "Development Key",
      "last_used": "2023-06-01T09:08:07Z",
      "permission_level": "admin",
      "created_at": "2023-05-15T10:00:00Z",
      "expires_at": null,
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Revoking an API Key

If you believe a key has been compromised or is no longer needed, you should revoke it immediately.

### Via the Console UI

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in the left sidebar
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click the **Revoke** button
4. Confirm the action

### Via the API

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.plexe.ai/v1/keys/key_abc123def456 \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_ADMIN_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "key_id": "key_abc123def456",
  "status": "revoked",
  "revoked_at": "2023-06-15T14:30:45Z"
}
```

## Rotating API Keys

For security, it's good practice to periodically rotate your API keys. Here's a suggested process:

1. Create a new API key with the same permissions as the one you're replacing
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Monitor the "last_used" timestamp of the old key to ensure all systems have migrated
4. Once you confirm all systems are using the new key, revoke the old key

## Best Practices for API Key Management

1. **Use descriptive names**: Make it easy to identify what each key is used for
2. **Set expirations**: Use the `expiration_days` parameter to create keys that automatically expire
3. **Least privilege principle**: Only grant the permissions a key actually needs
4. **Monitor usage**: Regularly check the "last_used" timestamp and usage patterns
5. **Secure storage**: Store API keys in secure environment variables or secret management systems, never in code repositories
6. **Regular rotation**: Rotate keys periodically, especially for production environments
7. **Different keys for different environments**: Use separate keys for development, testing, and production

<Info>
If you believe an API key has been compromised, revoke it immediately and check the API usage logs for any suspicious activity.
