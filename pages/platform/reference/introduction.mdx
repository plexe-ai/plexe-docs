The Plexe Platform API provides programmatic access to the Plexe machine learning platform, allowing you to build, deploy, and use ML models without managing infrastructure.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are accessible via this base URL:

```
https://api.plexe.ai
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. You have two options for authentication:

Option 1: Include your key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/models/list \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Option 2: Include your key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/models/list \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

You can generate API keys in the [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai) under Settings > API Keys. See the [Manage API Keys](/platform/how-to/manage_api_keys) guide for details.

## Request Format

For endpoints that accept data (POST, PUT, PATCH), provide a JSON-formatted request body with the appropriate Content-Type header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.plexe.ai/models/build \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Model",
    "intent": "Predict customer churn"
  }'
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses include the requested data, while error responses include an error message and relevant details. The HTTP status code indicates the result of the operation.

Example success response:

```json
{
  "model_id": "mdl_abc123def456",
  "name": "Customer Churn Predictor",
  "status": "READY",
  "created_at": "2023-06-15T08:15:45Z"
}
```

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "Missing required field: intent",
    "status": 400
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

The API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage. Current limits are:

- **Basic tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro tier**: 500 requests per minute
- **Enterprise tier**: Custom limits available

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait before retrying.

## Pagination

List endpoints (those returning multiple items) support pagination using the `limit` and `offset` query parameters:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/models?limit=10&offset=20 \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Paginated responses include metadata about the total count and pagination:

```json
{
  "models": [ ... ],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 45,
    "limit": 10,
    "offset": 20,
    "has_more": true
  }
}
```

## API Categories

The Plexe Platform API is organized into these main categories:

1. **[Authentication](/platform/reference/endpoints/auth)**: Managing API keys and user access
2. **[Data Management](/platform/reference/endpoints/data)**: Uploading, retrieving, and managing datasets
3. **[Model Management](/platform/reference/endpoints/models)**: Building, deploying, and managing ML models

## Using the API

For a step-by-step guide on using the API, see the [Platform API Quickstart](/platform/tutorials/quickstart_api) tutorial.

## API Versioning

The current API version is `v1`. We maintain backward compatibility within a major version. When breaking changes are necessary, we'll introduce a new major version (e.g., `v2`) while continuing to support the previous version for a reasonable transition period.

## Client Libraries

We provide official client libraries for several programming languages:

* **Python**: `pip install plexe-client`
* **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `npm install @plexe/client`
* **Java**: Available via Maven Central
* **Go**: `go get github.com/plexe-ai/plexe-go-client`

Example using the Python client:

```python
from plexe_client import PlexeClient

client = PlexeClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")

# List models
models = client.models.list()
print(models)

# Get a specific model
model = client.models.get("mdl_abc123def456")
print(model)
```
