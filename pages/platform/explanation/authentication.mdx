## Authentication Overview

The Plexe Platform uses a robust authentication system to secure access to your resources and services. This page
explains how authentication works, how to manage API keys, and best practices for security.

## Authentication Methods

### API Keys

For programmatic access to the Plexe API, API keys are the primary authentication method. API keys:

- Are long, random strings prefixed with `plx_sk_`
- Must be included in the `x-api-key` header of all API requests
- Have specific permission levels assigned when created
- Can be revoked or rotated at any time
- Are tied to your account for usage tracking and billing

Example API request with authentication:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/v1/models \
  -H "x-api-key: plx_sk_12345abcdef67890ghijklmnop"
```

### Console Authentication

For access to the [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai), the following authentication methods are supported:

1. **Email/Password:** Standard account credentials
2. **OAuth Providers:** Sign in with Google, GitHub, etc. (if enabled)

The Console uses secure, token-based authentication with automatic session expiration for security.

## Managing API Keys

### Creating API Keys

API keys can be created in two ways:

1. **Via the Console:**
   - Navigate to the Settings â†’ API Keys section
   - Click "Create New API Key"
   - Assign a descriptive name and required permissions
   - Copy the key immediately (it will only be shown once)

2. **Via the API:**
   - You can programmatically create API keys using an existing key with appropriate permissions
   - See the [Manage API Keys](/platform/how-to/manage_api_keys) guide for details

### API Key Permissions

When creating an API key, you can assign specific permission levels:

- **Read-only:** Can only make GET requests to fetch information
- **Read & Write:** Can both read data and create or modify resources
- **Admin:** Full access to all API functionality including user management

### API Key Best Practices

1. **Limit Access:** Create keys with the minimum permissions needed
2. **Use Descriptive Names:** Help identify the purpose of each key
3. **Secure Storage:** Store keys securely; never in public repositories or client-side code
4. **Regular Rotation:** Change keys periodically, especially for production systems
5. **Immediate Revocation:** If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately

## Security Features

### TLS Encryption

All communication with the Plexe Platform (both API and Console) is encrypted using TLS (HTTPS). This ensures that your data and authentication credentials are protected in transit.

### Key Visibility

For security, full API keys are only displayed once at creation time. After that, the Console will only show a truncated version (first few and last few characters).

### Access Logs

The Platform maintains comprehensive logs of authentication attempts and API key usage. These can be viewed in the Console for security monitoring and auditing.

### Rate Limiting

To protect against brute force and denial of service attacks, the API implements rate limiting. If you exceed the allowed request rate, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.

### Session Management

For Console users, sessions automatically expire after periods of inactivity. Sensitive actions may require re-authentication for additional security.

## Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

Enterprise accounts can enable Multi-factor Authentication for added security:

1. **Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP):** Using authentication apps like Google Authenticator or Authy
2. **SMS Verification:** Receiving codes via text message
3. **Email Verification:** Receiving codes via email
4. **Hardware Security Keys:** Using physical security keys like YubiKey (where supported)

## Authentication Errors

Common authentication-related errors you may encounter:

| HTTP Status | Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | `invalid_key` | API key is invalid or malformed |
| 401 | `expired_key` | API key has expired |
| 401 | `revoked_key` | API key has been revoked |
| 403 | `insufficient_permissions` | API key lacks required permissions for this operation |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests in a given time period |

## Example Authentication Workflows

### API Key Authentication in Python

```python
import requests
import os

# Best practice: Load API key from environment variable
api_key = os.environ.get("PLEXE_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("PLEXE_API_KEY environment variable not set")

# Set up headers with authentication
headers = {
    "x-api-key": api_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Make authenticated request
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.plexe.ai/v1/models",
    headers=headers
)

# Check for authentication errors
if response.status_code == 401:
    print("Authentication failed: Invalid or expired API key")
elif response.status_code == 403:
    print("Permission denied: Your API key doesn't have access to this resource")
else:
    # Process successful response
    print(f"Success! Found {len(response.json())} models")
```

### API Key Rotation Best Practice

```python
import requests
import os
import json

# Current and new API keys (latter will be obtained from API response)
current_api_key = os.environ.get("PLEXE_API_KEY")
new_api_key = None

# Headers for the request to create new key
headers = {
    "x-api-key": current_api_key,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Step 1: Create a new API key
try:
    create_response = requests.post(
        "https://api.plexe.ai/v1/keys",
        headers=headers,
        json={
            "name": "Rotated Key " + datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
            "permission_level": "read_write", # Same as current key
            "expiration_days": 90
        }
    )
    
    if create_response.status_code == 200:
        result = create_response.json()
        new_api_key = result.get("key")
        print(f"Created new API key with ID: {result.get('key_id')}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to create new key: {create_response.text}")
        exit(1)
        
    # Step 2: Verify the new key works
    verify_headers = {
        "x-api-key": new_api_key,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    verify_response = requests.get(
        "https://api.plexe.ai/v1/models",
        headers=verify_headers
    )
    
    if verify_response.status_code == 200:
        print("New key verified working!")
        
        # Step 3: Revoke the old key
        revoke_response = requests.delete(
            f"https://api.plexe.ai/v1/keys/{old_key_id}",
            headers=verify_headers
        )
        
        if revoke_response.status_code == 200:
            print("Old key successfully revoked")
        else:
            print(f"Failed to revoke old key: {revoke_response.text}")
            
    else:
        print(f"New key verification failed: {verify_response.text}")
        print("Keeping old key active")
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during key rotation: {e}")
```

## Enterprise SSO Integration

Enterprise customers can integrate their existing identity provider (IdP) with the Plexe Platform using SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC). This provides:

- Centralized user management
- Consistent security policies
- Simplified access for team members
- Automated user provisioning/deprovisioning

Contact Plexe's support team for assistance with SSO configuration.
