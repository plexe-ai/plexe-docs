API keys allow you to authenticate requests to the Plexe Platform API programmatically. Manage your API keys
securely through the Plexe Console.

## Accessing API Key Management

1.  Log in to the [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai) (Replace with actual URL).
2.  Navigate to the "Account Settings" or "API Keys" section.

## Creating an API Key

1.  Click the "Create New API Key" or similar button.
2.  Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "dev-script-key", "production-app-key") to help you identify its purpose later.
3.  Click "Create".
4.  **Important:** Your new API key will be displayed **only once**. Copy it immediately and store it securely (e.g., in a password manager or secret vault). **You will not be able to retrieve the key again.**

## Viewing API Keys

The API Key management section will list your existing keys, typically showing:

* Key Name
* A portion of the key (e.g., the first few characters) for identification
* Creation Date
* Last Used Date (if tracked)
* Status (Active/Inactive)

You **cannot** view the full secret key after creation for security reasons.

## Revoking an API Key

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

1.  Find the key you want to revoke in the list.
2.  Click the "Revoke", "Delete", or similar button associated with that key.
3.  Confirm the action when prompted.

Revoked keys can no longer be used to authenticate API requests.

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for all requests to the Plexe API.

```python
import requests
import os

api_key = "YOUR_PLEXE_API_KEY" # Replace with your actual key or load securely
base_url = "https://api.plexe.ai" # Replace with actual API endpoint

headers = {
    "x-api-key": api_key
}

# Example: List models
try:
    response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/models", headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()
    print("API request successful:", response.json())
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"API request failed: {e}")
    if e.response is not None:
        print(f"Status Code: {e.response.status_code}, Response: {e.response.text}")
```

<Warning>
**Treat your API keys like passwords.** Do not share them, embed them directly in public code (like frontend JavaScript), or commit them to version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions.
