title: 'Monitor Jobs'
description: 'Track the progress and status of long-running operations on the Plexe Platform.'

On the Plexe Platform, many operations—such as model building and large data processing tasks—run asynchronously as jobs. This guide explains how to monitor these jobs through both the Console UI and API.

## Understanding Jobs

Jobs represent long-running operations that may take seconds to hours to complete. Common job types include:

- Model building
- Large-scale batch predictions
- Data processing operations
- Model deployments (complex ones)

Each job has:
- A unique job ID
- A current status
- Progress indicators (when available)
- Associated results (upon completion)
- Error details (if it fails)

## Monitoring via Console UI

### Viewing All Jobs

1. Log in to the [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai)
2. Navigate to the **Jobs** section from the left sidebar
3. You'll see a list of all your jobs with their:
   - Job ID
   - Type
   - Status
   - Creation time
   - Completion time (if finished)

The list can be filtered by:
- Status (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Type (Build, Deploy, Predict, etc.)
- Date range

### Viewing Job Details

To see detailed information about a specific job:

1. From the Jobs list, click on the job ID
2. The job details page shows:
   - Full status information
   - Progress percentage (for supported job types)
   - Job parameters
   - Runtime metrics
   - Logs (for debugging)
   - Results (if completed successfully)
   - Error details (if failed)

### Job Status Indicators

Jobs progress through these statuses:

- **PENDING**: Job has been created but hasn't started processing
- **RUNNING**: Job is actively being processed
- **COMPLETED**: Job finished successfully
- **FAILED**: Job encountered an error and couldn't complete
- **CANCELLED**: Job was manually cancelled before completion

Some complex jobs may also have intermediate statuses like:
- **PREPARING**: Setting up resources
- **VALIDATING**: Checking inputs or prerequisites
- **FINALIZING**: Finishing final steps before completion

## Job Monitoring

Currently, job monitoring is only available through the Plexe Console UI. Programmatic job monitoring via API is planned for a future release.

## Setting Up Notifications

You can set up notifications to be informed when jobs complete through the console:

### Via Console UI

1. Go to **Settings** → **Notifications**
2. Click **Add Webhook**
3. Enter your webhook URL
4. Select the events you want to be notified about (e.g., `job.completed`, `job.failed`)
5. Click **Save**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| Job stuck in PENDING | Resource constraints, service backlog | Wait or contact support if persists for >30 min |
| Job failed with "resource not found" | Referenced resource (upload, model) doesn't exist | Verify resources exist and are accessible to your account |
| Job failed with permission errors | Account lacks required permissions | Ensure your account has the necessary permissions for the operation |
| Missing job details | Job data expired (older than 30 days) | Jobs data is retained for 30 days, export needed data |

### Getting Support

For issues with specific jobs:
1. Note the job ID
2. Check the job logs for error messages
3. If unable to resolve, contact Plexe support with the job ID and logs
4. For urgent issues, include "URGENT" in your support ticket

## Best Practices

1. **Record Job IDs:** Note job IDs shown in the console UI for any important operations
2. **Set up webhooks:** Configure notification webhooks for important job statuses
3. **Check regularly:** For critical operations, check job status regularly in the console
4. **Plan for delays:** Some operations like model training can take considerable time
5. **Contact support with IDs:** Always reference job IDs when contacting support
6. **Review logs:** For failed jobs, review logs carefully to understand failure reasons
