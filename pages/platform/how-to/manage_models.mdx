After creating models on the Plexe Platform, effective management helps you organize your work, track versions, and maintain optimal performance. This guide covers best practices for managing your models throughout their lifecycle.

## Viewing Your Models

### Via Console UI

1. Log in to the [Plexe Console](https://console.plexe.ai)
2. Navigate to the **Models** section from the left sidebar
3. View your models with key information:
   - Model name
   - Latest status
   - Creation date
   - Latest metric values
   - Deployment status

### Via API

```bash
# List all models
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/models \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get details for a specific model
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/models/{model_name}/{model_version} \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Model Versioning

The Plexe Platform automatically handles versioning when you create new iterations of the same model.

### Creating a New Version

#### Via Console UI

1. Navigate to the model details page
2. Click **Create New Version**
3. Provide updated parameters (e.g., new data, modified intent)
4. Click **Build**

#### Via API

```bash
# To create a new version, use the same model creation endpoint with the same model name
curl -X POST https://api.plexe.ai/models/{model_name} \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "upload_id": "upload_123abc",
    "goal": "Updated goal for improved accuracy",
    "metric": "f1_score"
  }'
```

### Comparing Versions

#### Via Console UI

1. Navigate to the model details page
2. Click on the **Versions** tab
3. Select two versions to compare
4. View side-by-side comparison of:
   - Performance metrics
   - Input/output schemas
   - Training parameters
   - Feature importance

{/* The model comparison API endpoint is not currently available */}

## Model Metadata and Descriptions

Adding metadata helps with organization and searchability.

### Updating Model Metadata

#### Via Console UI

1. Navigate to the model details page
2. Click **Edit** next to model name or description
3. Update the information
4. Click **Save**

#### Via API

```bash

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tags": ["production", "finance", "classification"]
  }'
```

### Filtering Models by Tags

## Model Performance Monitoring

### Viewing Performance Metrics

#### Via Console UI

1. Navigate to the model details page
2. Click on the **Metrics** tab
3. View all evaluation metrics
4. See charts for key metrics over time (if multiple versions exist)

#### Via API

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.plexe.ai/models/{model_name}/{model_version}/metrics \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Setting Up Performance Alerts

#### Via Console UI

1. Navigate to the model details page
2. Click on the **Monitoring** tab
3. Click **Add Alert**
4. Configure conditions (e.g., "Alert if accuracy drops below 0.9")
5. Set notification methods (email, webhook)
6. Click **Save**

{/* Performance alerts via API are not available in the current API version */}

## Managing Deployments

Each model can have multiple deployments across environments.

### Viewing Deployments

2. Click on the **Deployments** tab
3. View all active deployments with:
   - Environment
   - Version
   - Health status
   - Request volume
   - Creation date

{/* Deployment listing via API is not available in the current API version */}

### Promoting Versions

When a new model version passes testing, promote it to production.

#### Via Console UI

1. Navigate to the model details page
2. Click on the **Versions** tab
3. Find the version to promote
4. Click **Deploy**
5. Select "production" environment

## Advanced Management Features

### Model Registry (Enterprise Feature)

For enterprise customers, the Model Registry provides:
- Model approval workflows
- Compliance documentation
- Governance controls
- Audit logging

### A/B Testing

A/B testing for models is available through the console UI. This feature allows you to compare the performance of different model versions by directing a portion of traffic to each version.

### Model Retraining Schedules

Automated model retraining schedules can be configured through the console UI. This feature allows you to keep your models up-to-date with the latest data.

{/* Note: The A/B testing and model retraining schedule APIs are not available in the current API version */}

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions for models
2. **Version Documentation**: Add detailed notes when creating new versions
3. **Environment Separation**: Deploy to dev/staging before production
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive or delete unused models and versions
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Set up alerts for model performance degradation
6. **Resource Optimization**: Delete deployments when not in use to save resources
7. **Tags for Organization**: Use a consistent tagging strategy to organize models
8. **Export Backups**: Regularly export important models as a backup
9. **Access Control**: Carefully manage who can modify production models
10. **Model Cards**: Document model information for better team collaboration

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your models throughout their lifecycle on the Plexe Platform, ensuring optimal organization, performance, and collaboration.
