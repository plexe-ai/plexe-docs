### Choose Your Path

**Python Library (`plexe`)**
- Integrate directly with Python code via `pip install plexe`
- Control your own compute resources and data
- Bring your preferred LLM provider credentials
- Ideal for: developers, data scientists, ML engineers

**Plexe Platform (`console.plexe.ai` / `api.plexe.ai`)**
- Access via web interface or REST API
- Let us manage infrastructure, scaling, and deployments
- Simplified authentication and billing
- Ideal for: product teams, analysts, organizations seeking enterprise-grade ML

## How It Works

Plexe's multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models works through a sequential process:

1. **Planning:** Analyzes your intent and data to develop a model-building strategy
2. **Code Generation:** Creates appropriate ML code using popular libraries (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow)
3. **Execution & Refinement:** Runs the generated code, evaluates results, and iteratively improves performance
4. **Deployment:** Packages the model for inference or deploys it to production infrastructure

## Key Benefits

- **Natural Language Interface:** Describe what you want, not how to build it
- **Rapid Iteration:** Test ideas and create models in minutes instead of days
- **No ML Expertise Required:** Leverage state-of-the-art ML without specialized knowledge
- **Production-Ready Code:** Generate clean, documented, and maintainable ML workflows
- **Full Transparency:** Examine and customize all generated code
