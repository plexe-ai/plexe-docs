This tutorial guides you through the essential steps to install the `plexe` library, define a model using natural language, build it using your data, and make predictions.

## 1. Installation

First, install the `plexe` library using pip. You can choose between a standard installation, a lightweight version (without deep learning dependencies), or include all optional dependencies.

```bash {{ label: "Standard Installation" }}
pip install plexe
```

```bash {{ label: "Lightweight Installation" }}
pip install plexe[lightweight]
```

```bash {{ label: "Include Deep Learning" }}
pip install plexe[all]
```

## 2\. Set Up Environment Variables

Plexe uses Large Language Models (LLMs) under the hood via the [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) library. You need to configure API keys for the LLM provider you want to use. Set them as environment variables:

```bash
# Example for OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Example for Anthropic
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

Plexe defaults to `openai/gpt-4o-mini` if no provider is specified.

## 3\. Prepare Your Data

For this example, let's assume you have a CSV file named `housing_data.csv` with features like `square_footage`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, and a target column `price`.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your data (replace with your actual data loading)
try:
    df = pd.read_csv("housing_data.csv")
    print("Dataset loaded successfully:")
    print(df.head())
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: housing_data.csv not found. Please create a sample CSV.")
    # Create a dummy DataFrame for demonstration if file not found
    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'square_footage': [1500, 2100, 1800, 2500, 1200],
        'bedrooms': [3, 4, 3, 5, 2],
        'bathrooms': [2, 2.5, 2, 3, 1.5],
        'price': [300000, 450000, 380000, 550000, 250000]
    })
    print("Using dummy data:")
    print(df.head())

# Ensure your DataFrame is ready
datasets = [df]
```

## 4\. Define and Build the Model

Import the `plexe` library and create a `Model` instance. Define your goal using the `intent` parameter. You can also specify input and output schemas, though Plexe can often infer them.

```python
import plexe
import logging

# Optional: Configure logging for more details
# plexe.configure_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Define the model's intent
# Input and output schemas can often be inferred if data is provided
model = plexe.Model(
    intent="Predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms."
    # Optionally define schemas:
    # input_schema={"square_footage": float, "bedrooms": int, "bathrooms": float},
    # output_schema={"price": float}
)

# Build the model
# This process involves LLM calls, code generation, and execution.
# It might take a few minutes depending on complexity and provider.
print("Starting model build...")
model.build(
    datasets=datasets,
    provider="openai/gpt-4o-mini", # Specify your preferred LLM provider
    max_iterations=5,              # Try up to 5 different model approaches
    timeout=600,                   # Set a maximum of 10 minutes for the entire process
    run_timeout=180,               # Maximum 3 minutes per individual run
    chain_of_thought=True,         # Show detailed reasoning steps (default: True)
    verbose=False                  # Don't show detailed agent logs (default: False)
)

print(f"Model build finished. Model state: {model.get_state()}")
```

{/* Note component with proper JSX syntax */}
<Note>
  The `build` process involves multiple steps orchestrated by AI agents: planning, code generation, execution, analysis, and potentially fixing code. Enabling `chain_of_thought=True` provides verbose output showing these steps.
</Note>

## 5\. Make Predictions

Once the model state is `READY`, you can use the `predict` method.

```python
if model.get_state() == "ready":
    # Prepare input data as a dictionary
    input_data = {
        "square_footage": 1900.0,
        "bedrooms": 3,
        "bathrooms": 2.0
    }

    print(f"\nMaking prediction for input: {input_data}")
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    print(f"Predicted price: {prediction}")

    # Example with validation
    # prediction_validated = model.predict(input_data, validate_input=True, validate_output=True)
    # print(f"Validated prediction: {prediction_validated}")

else:
    print("\nModel is not ready for prediction. Check logs for errors.")

```

## 6\. Inspect the Model

You can get metadata and a description of the built model.

```python
if model.get_state() == "ready":
    print("\nModel Metadata:")
    print(model.get_metadata())

    print("\nModel Metrics:")
    print(model.get_metrics())

    print("\nModel Description:")
    # The describe() method returns a detailed object, print its text representation
    print(model.describe().as_text())
    # Or use as_markdown() or to_dict() / to_json()
    # print(model.describe().as_markdown())
else:
    print("\nModel information not available as it's not in READY state.")
```

## 7\. Save and Load (Optional)

Persist your trained model for later use.

```python
import os

if model.get_state() == "ready":
    model_filename = f"{model.identifier}.tar.gz"
    save_path = plexe.save_model(model, model_filename)
    print(f"\nModel saved to: {save_path}")

    # Load the model later
    if os.path.exists(save_path):
      loaded_model = plexe.load_model(save_path)
      print(f"Model loaded successfully. Intent: {loaded_model.intent}")
      # You can now use loaded_model.predict()
    else:
        print("Saved model file not found for loading example.")

```
